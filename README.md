# Probability of Default Model Project

## How to run: 
1. Clone the repo.

2. Open the **main.ipynb** jupyter notebook, run the first two cells. 

3. In the third cell, manually input the path to holdout sample as the function parameter. Then, a **output.csv** file should be generated in the root directory. The csv file has one single column called **default_prob** which is the prediction by our model.
