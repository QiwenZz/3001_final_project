## how to run: 
1. open the main.ipynb jupyter notebook, run the first two cells. 

2. In the third cell, manually input the path to holdout sample as the function parameter. Then, a **output.csv** file should be generated in the root directory. The csv file has one single column called **default_prob** which is the prediction by our model.
